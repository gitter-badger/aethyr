//60 sec timeout on Python startup in case Flash crashes during startup (i.e. never connects)
//Put songs in folders in Aethyr folder, seperated by Artist/Album name - otherwise 1000 songs has long load time...
//Turn on loading icon while getting libraries.
//Freeze library switch while loading.
//Performance problem in pyc?  How? (gencache)
//Allow Queued songs during download
//Remove Program Files folder during uninstall
//Rename flash to aethyrHelper.exe and python to aethyr.exe
//Cache libraries so future loads are much faster
//Songs/Packets dropped - (song plays are failing) - during high processor load.  any remedy?  improve CPU usage? (insert time.sleep(0.1)?)
//Ensure compatibility for error message for library disconnect (Works for fast systems, wtf honestly)
//Add download directory selection
//Block download thread until necessary. (use raw sockets instead of winpcap)

* Change delimiter.
